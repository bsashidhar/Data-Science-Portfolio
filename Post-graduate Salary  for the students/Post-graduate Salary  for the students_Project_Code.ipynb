    "In terms of outliers, there are quite a lot of them in all three of the terciles/variables. Most are above about $70,000. It is difficult with earnings, and this is also what I'm trying to investigate, because people and careers make such different levels of money. It is highly dependent on many factors: industry, career role, location, level in a company, etc. Therefore, I don't want to remove any of the outliers, since these could be key in showing how one's university/education influences the range of earnings/salary that one can make post-grad."
