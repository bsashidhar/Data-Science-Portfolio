## Projects

### [1.	Fertility Rate Analysis](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/705218ac7ac8ad5db3c13403ccbebca8d65dd5d4/Fertility%20Rate%20Analysis)  

#### Introduction
The idea and question of fertility is the topic that I choose for the project. It has become more of a prevalent issue, at least in the United States, for women to struggle with infertility and therefore not being able to have children naturally or maybe at all. In terms of birth rates, I would think that the issue of reproductive health in women (and maybe even men) has an impact on the number of kids that are born year-to-year in the country. Therefore, the problem that I want to research is the problem of infertility in America and how it has impacted birth rate. With the concept of infertility, I would also like to research how various factors influence one’s fertility and whether we can predict the fertility of an individual based on their demographic and environmental variables.

#### Research questions 
1. What is the weight of men’s and women’s reproductive health in influencing a couple’s ability to have children? 
2. What is the average age for women to try to start having children? 
3. What is the current difference in birth rates from one country to another? 
4. How have non-traditional methods of having children influenced birth rate, such as adoption/IVF/etc? 
5. What role does proper sex education play in fertility and reproductive health? 
6. What resources are provided to people who are experiencing issues with infertility? 
7. Does the current calculation of birth rate account for non-traditional methods of child delivery? 
8. What are the key factors that play a role in one’s fertility, men and women?


### [2.	Post-graduate Salary  for the students](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/705218ac7ac8ad5db3c13403ccbebca8d65dd5d4/Post-graduate%20Salary%20%20for%20the%20students) 

#### Introduction

### [3.	BRAIN STROKE PREDICTION](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/705218ac7ac8ad5db3c13403ccbebca8d65dd5d4/BRAIN%20STROKE%20PREDICTION)

#### Introduction:
A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts (or ruptures). When that happens, part of the brain cannot get the blood (and oxygen) it needs, so it and brain cells die.
There are two types of Brain strokes:

•	Ischemic Stroke – Caused by blood clots that block an artery and blood supply to brain is cut off

•	Hemorrhagic Stroke – Caused by blow out of blood vessels in the brain.

#### Business Problem 
The main objective behind choosing this topic is irrespective of age, people these days are getting brain strokes due to our lifestyle and care towards our health. If we can predict the outcome from stroke history and various factors, we can avoid strokes ahead and lead a healthy life.


### [4.	Vehicle Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/705218ac7ac8ad5db3c13403ccbebca8d65dd5d4/Vehicle%20Loan%20Default%20Prediction) 
#### Introduction 
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.
Financial institutions have the need to accurately predict the probability of borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments) on the due date. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and important determinants can be identified which can be further used for minimizing the default rates.
Financial institutions are using classification models to predict the default or raise red flags on the accounts which are likely to default. One major problem is of Imbalanced Distribution of classes i.e. the available training data consists more of non-default accounts vs. default accounts. 

### [5.	Air Travel - The Safest mode of Transportation](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/cefe85ca97e27bb11624cef82801c3d5e1903f3b/Air%20Travel%20-%20The%20Safest%20mode%20of%20Transportation)
#### Introduction 
For the visualizations of the airline safety data, I have planned to show the trends. I started with a bar chart that depicted the total number of Fatalities between 1985-1999 & 2000-2014, drawn from an initial dataset. From this initial look, I then wanted to dive into the data regarding specific airlines. I narrowed it down to the top twenty airlines, since the airlines which have the most people flying will encounter more incidents. I chose mostly bar charts for these visualizations since it’s an easy way to depict categories and their differences. By looking at the dashboard, it is quick to determine the airline trends and how to correlate the total number of incidents vs total number of fatal accidents. I have chosen Line charts to show the trend of accidents and trend of Fatalities over the period between 1940 thru 2022. 

### [6.	Finance - Transaction Log Analysis](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/cefe85ca97e27bb11624cef82801c3d5e1903f3b/Finance%20-%20Transaction%20Log%20Analysis) 

#### Objective
Streamline large volumes of transaction logs, identifying transaction volumes, peak transaction times, and other important metrics.

#### Dataset : Bank Transactions Dataset ( Kaggle) 

The dataset used for the project is presently only one of few on Kaggle with information on the rising risk of digital financial fraud, emphasizing the difficulty in obtaining such data. This synthetically generated dataset consists of payments from various customers made in different time periods and with different amounts. 

### [7.	Employee Attrition Prediction](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/cefe85ca97e27bb11624cef82801c3d5e1903f3b/Employee%20Attrition%20Prediction) 
#### Introduction 
Organizations are realizing that employees are valuable assets. Employee Attrition is a major concern for organizations because the functioning of the organization entirely depends on the pool of employees. Attrition can impact productivity, team dynamics, and overall company performance. Attrition rate defines the organization’s image. Higher the attrition rate, the organization has to face some incurred costs to recruit, induct, placement and train the employee. 
#### Business Problem 
Develop a machine learning model to address the below: 

• Analyze the reason for employee attrition. 

• Predict employee attrition within an organization.
#### Dataset : Employee attrition Dataset ( Kaggle) 

This is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists, which can help uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition.

### [8.	House Price Prediction](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/cefe85ca97e27bb11624cef82801c3d5e1903f3b/House%20Price%20Prediction) 
#### Introduction 
In recent years, the real estate industry has experienced rapid growth, making it an interesting area for research and experimentation. One common task in this field is forecasting house prices, which can be challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of the market. In this experiment, we will perform EDA and build models, to analyze data and make predictions about house prices. By applying this technique, we aim to gain insights into the factors that affect house prices and improve our ability to forecast them accurately. 
#### Business Problem 
Develop a machine learning model to address the below:

•	Predict the sales price for each house.

•	Evaluate Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price
#### Dataset :  Housing dataset ( Kaggle) 

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.

### [9.	Creditcard Fraud Detection](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/cefe85ca97e27bb11624cef82801c3d5e1903f3b/Creditcard%20Fraud%20Detection) 
#### Introduction 
Credit Card Frauds are the cases of using someone else's credit cards for financial transactions without the information of the card owner. With the rise in the e-commerce and the recent boom of OTT platforms during the Coronavirus Pandemic, use of credit cards has risen exponentially along with other payment processes. As all the things in the nature are binary, cases of credit card frauds have also achieved high numbers. Global economy pays the price of more than $ 24 billion per year due to these frauds. Thus, it becomes essential to solve this problem and as a result a lot of startups have been born into this $ 30 billion industry. It is also important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.  Thus, building automated models for such a rising problem statement is necessary.
#### Business Problem 
Develop a machine learning model to address the below:

•	Classify whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or genuine and handle unbalanced dataset.

#### Dataset :  Housing dataset ( Kaggle) 

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

### [10.	Covid-19 Vaccines Efficacy](https://github.com/bsashidhar/data_science_portfolio.github.io/tree/cefe85ca97e27bb11624cef82801c3d5e1903f3b/Covid-19%20Vaccines%20Efficacy)
### Introduction 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Preventing the infection can be done by following - staying at least 6 feet apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. 

COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by building immunity without the risk of severe illness and vaccination is one measure to help stop the pandemic.

#### Business Problem 
The project aims to convey the analysis of different ongoing vaccination programs within United States of America by using all publications, reports, and news articles and review all available data to find how effective vaccines are at achieving multiple outcomes.
